# ML-Global-Freedom-Dynamics
This project analyzes the key social, political, economic factors influencing the Human Freedom Index (HFI) across 165 countries (2000–2020). Using statistical and machine learning models (GLM, LASSO, kNN, Random Forest, Boosting), it predicts freedom scores, identifies influential determinants (e.g.  inflation), and highlights global trends.


Model Development:
Applied a range of statistical and machine learning models:
Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
LASSO and Ridge Regression
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Random Forest
Boosting

Evaluation Metrics:
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Measures average prediction error.
R²: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
Error Rate: Measures prediction accuracy.


Conclusion:
This project highlights the significant influence of political, religious, and economic factors on global freedom. By leveraging machine learning models, it demonstrates the predictive power of these indicators, paving the way for better policy-making and a deeper understanding of the components of human freedom.
